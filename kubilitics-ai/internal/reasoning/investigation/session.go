package investigation

import "context"

// Package investigation provides investigation session state management.
//
// Responsibilities:
//   - Manage the complete lifecycle of a single investigation
//   - Maintain investigation state machine (Created → Investigating → Concluded → Archived)
//   - Track hypothesis generation and evolution
//   - Record tool calls and results
//   - Accumulate findings with evidence and confidence scores
//   - Manage investigation timeout and cancellation
//   - Calculate final confidence in conclusions
//   - Persist investigation state for audit trail
//
// Investigation State Machine:
//
//   Created
//     ↓ (Reasoning Engine starts investigation)
//   Investigating
//     ↓ (Gathering context, generating hypotheses, calling tools)
//     ↓ (Multiple tool calls as LLM explores hypotheses)
//     ↓ (Validating findings and drawing conclusions)
//   Concluded
//     ↓ (Investigation complete, action proposed or archived)
//   Archived (if no action taken)
//     ↓ (Retained for historical reference)
//
// Investigation State Transitions:
//   - Created → Investigating: Automatic when Reasoning Engine starts
//   - Investigating → Concluded: When LLM generates final conclusion
//   - Investigating → Cancelled: If user cancels or timeout reached
//   - Concluded → Archived: After N days of no activity
//
// Investigation Fields:
//   - ID: Unique identifier (UUID)
//   - Type: Type of investigation (pod-crash, performance, security, cost, etc.)
//   - State: Current state in state machine
//   - CreatedAt: Timestamp when investigation started
//   - StartedAt: Timestamp when investigation began (may differ from created)
//   - ConcludedAt: Timestamp when investigation finished
//   - UserID: User who triggered investigation
//   - Description: Initial problem description
//   - Context: Built cluster context used
//   - Hypothesis: Current/final hypothesis
//   - ToolCalls: List of all tool calls made during investigation
//   - Findings: List of findings with evidence and confidence
//   - Conclusion: Final conclusion and root cause
//   - Confidence: Overall confidence in conclusion (0-100%)
//   - Actions: Proposed or executed actions
//   - Status: Current status code
//
// Integration Points:
//   - Reasoning Engine: Manages investigation lifecycle
//   - Audit Logger: Persists all state changes
//   - Backend Proxy: Query cluster data
//   - MCP Server: Execute tools
//   - World Model: Fetch cluster state
//   - Prompt Manager: Render prompts with investigation context
